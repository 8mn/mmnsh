# Hello, World!

This is my personal wiki where I share everything I know about this world In form of a website.



## What is this site? Why this exists?

Its a collection of essays, notes, and half-baked explorations I'm always tending to. Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, this site act more like free form, work-in-progress wiki. Also the idea of blog sounded redundant, I am always seeking things that are out of “convention”, this wiki is one of them.


## Grow your own digital garden
Such wikis are also called digital garden. There is [DigitalGardens community on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/).

## Where to start?
If this is your first time visiting this wiki, you can just start reading from the top entry down and see what sparks your interest.

This website is structured like a book and link on the sidebar is a chapter. Some chapters have sub sections which are collapsed.

I will be updating this wiki quite often as I use it myself daily.

Have fun exploring!
