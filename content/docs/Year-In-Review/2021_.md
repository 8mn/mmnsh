## **Inspired by James clear**
Each year, I write my Annual Review and share it publicly. My Annual Review answers three questions.
### What went well this year?
- Understood what drove me towards learning design: It is some combination of mixing different elements and showing my identity  
- Became comfortable with not knowing everything in programming, instead became efficient in finding a solution to any problem
- Health
    - Physical: Started running regularly.
    - Mental: Meditation and making gratitude lists are highy underapperciated. I will write about my progress more in few months.
- Built things for myself(my personal site and this wiki)
- Did travel a lot locally.
### What didn’t go so well this year?
- Didn't meet any new people(sigh): The only place where I meet new people is my college. Since this year, I didn't went to college at all I didn't meet any new poeple. Perhaps, Either I should change where I meet new people or indulge in hobbies/clubs that forces me to meet new people.
- Didn't do exercises/lift weights.
### What am I working toward?
- Becoming independent(Financially).
- Meeting as many new people as I can.
- Writing regularly.
- Exercising more/gain muscle (Exercises other than cardio)
- Speaking Marathi. Marathi is my native language _sigh_.
- Building/designing a lot of things/products
- Hopefully travel more(outstations)
