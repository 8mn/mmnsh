# BOOKS

 I read a lot of books(and you should too), It has become a habit now. Nothing gives me as much pleasure as reading a good book.

You read books because you can't meet enough people in your lifetime.

## How to read books(fast)
Here are the tips from one of my favourite author mark manson.

If a 500 page book seems daunting to you, you read too slowly. Here are some
tips to speed the process up:
- Once you get the point of a section (non-fiction), move on or skim the rest
of  it.  This  is  huge.  I  probably  only  actually  read  2/3  of  the  actual  words
someone writes.
- If the book is written poorly or you don’t enjoy it, stop reading it. It’s OK.
No reason to torture yourself. Just be sure you know WHY you don’t like it.
- If  a  book  only  has  a  few  chapters  you’re  interested  in,  just  read  those
chapters.
- If you feel like an author is being long-winded, skim sections until you get
to a part that really interests you again.
- Push yourself to read as fast as you can without missing information. You
can probably read twice as fast as you think you can, you just don’t try to.
- Use your finger underneath the lines as you read, believe it or not, this will
allow you to comprehend the words faster.

## How to start reading books
Initially start with books that interest you or talk to your friend who read books. I used to mostly read self-help books to learn about human behavivour. Books like **[The magic of thinking big](https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Thinking-Big-David-Schwartz/dp/0671646788)** and articles from **[waitbutwhy](https://waitbutwhy.com/)** blew my mind. This all started a chain reaction to explore more about humans and question things that everybody takes for granted.
